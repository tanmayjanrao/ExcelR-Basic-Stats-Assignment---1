# Sales & Discounts Dataset: Descriptive Analytics and Data Preprocessing

Overview
This project focuses on performing descriptive analytics, data visualization, and data preprocessing on a Sales & Discounts dataset. The goal is to prepare the dataset for further analysis and machine learning by computing basic statistics, visualizing data distributions, standardizing numerical variables, and converting categorical data into dummy variables.

Project Structure

Data Visualization

Standardization of Numerical Variables

Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables

Conclusion

1. Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns
Objective
To compute and analyze basic statistical measures for numerical columns in the dataset.

Steps
Load the dataset into a data analysis tool or programming environment (e.g., Python with pandas library).

Identify numerical columns in the dataset.

Calculate the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for these columns.

Provide a brief interpretation of these statistics.

2. Data Visualization
Objective
To visualize the distribution and relationship of numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.

Histograms
Plot histograms for each numerical column.

Analyze the distribution (e.g., skewness, presence of outliers) and provide inferences.

Boxplots
Create boxplots for numerical variables to identify outliers and the interquartile range.

Discuss any findings, such as extreme values or unusual distributions.

Bar Chart Analysis for Categorical Columns
Identify categorical columns in the dataset.

Create bar charts to visualize the frequency or count of each category.

Analyze the distribution of categories and provide insights.

3. Standardization of Numerical Variables
Objective
To scale numerical variables for uniformity, improving the datasetâ€™s suitability for analytical models.

Steps
Explain the concept of standardization (z-score normalization).

Standardize the numerical columns using z-score normalization.

Show before and after comparisons of the data distributions.

4. Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
Objective
To transform categorical variables into a format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms.

Steps
Discuss the need for converting categorical data into dummy variables (one-hot encoding).

Apply one-hot encoding to the categorical columns, creating binary (0 or 1) columns for each category.

Display a portion of the transformed dataset.

5. Conclusion
Key Findings
Summarize the key findings from the descriptive analytics and data visualizations.

Highlight any interesting patterns, trends, or outliers discovered during the analysis.

Importance of Data Preprocessing
Reflect on the importance of data preprocessing steps like standardization and one-hot encoding in data analysis and machine learning.

Discuss how these steps improve the quality and usability of the dataset for predictive modeling.
